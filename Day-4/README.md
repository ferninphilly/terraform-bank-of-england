# Day 4 - Review: Terraform Fundamentals

## Overview
Day 4 provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental Terraform concepts covered in Days 1-3. This day ensures you have a solid foundation before moving to intermediate topics in Day 5.

## Learning Path

### 1. Review Basics
**Directory**: `1-Review-Basics/`

Review core Terraform concepts:
- Provider configuration and version constraints
- Resource creation and dependencies
- State management and backend configuration
- Variables, locals, and outputs
- Type constraints and validation
- Lifecycle rules

**Exercise**: Create a complete, production-ready infrastructure setup demonstrating all basic concepts.

### 2. Review Advanced
**Directory**: `2-Review-Advanced/`

Review advanced basic concepts:
- Terraform functions and string manipulation
- Networking concepts (VNet, Subnets, NSG)
- Dynamic blocks for complex configurations
- Azure AD integration

**Exercise**: Create a comprehensive network infrastructure deployable across multiple environments.

### 3. Review Modules
**Directory**: `3-Review-Modules/`

Review module concepts:
- Module structure and best practices
- Module inputs and outputs
- Module dependencies
- Module versioning

**Exercise**: Create a reusable storage account module and use it in multiple scenarios.

## Objectives

By the end of Day 4, you should be able to:
- ✅ Configure Terraform providers and backends
- ✅ Create and manage Azure resources with Terraform
- ✅ Use variables, locals, and outputs effectively
- ✅ Implement validation and lifecycle rules
- ✅ Use Terraform functions for string manipulation
- ✅ Create and use Terraform modules
- ✅ Structure Terraform code following best practices

## Prerequisites

Before starting Day 4, ensure you have:
- Completed Days 1-3 exercises
- Azure subscription and CLI configured
- Terraform installed (version >= 1.5.0)
- Basic understanding of Azure resources

## Getting Started

1. Start with `1-Review-Basics/` to reinforce core concepts
2. Move to `2-Review-Advanced/` for networking and functions
3. Complete `3-Review-Modules/` for module understanding

Each exercise includes:
- Detailed README with objectives
- Starter Terraform files with TODOs
- Best practices and requirements

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip the review** - These exercises reinforce critical concepts
2. **Complete all TODOs** - They guide you through the learning process
3. **Experiment** - Try variations and see what happens
4. **Read error messages** - Terraform provides helpful feedback
5. **Use documentation** - Azure provider docs are your friend

## Next Steps

After completing Day 4, you'll be ready for Day 5, which covers:
- Advanced modules and inheritance
- Conditional creation and for_each loops
- Data sources and importing
- State management
- Terragrunt
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Advanced Terraform concepts
