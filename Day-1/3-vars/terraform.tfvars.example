# Example terraform.tfvars file
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and modify as needed
# terraform.tfvars is automatically loaded by Terraform

environment = "demo"

# Note: This file demonstrates how terraform.tfvars overrides default values
# The default value in variables.tf is "staging", but this file sets it to "demo"
# To test variable precedence, try:
# 1. Remove this file and run terraform plan (uses default "staging")
# 2. Keep this file and run terraform plan (uses "demo")
# 3. Set TF_VAR_environment="production" and run terraform plan (uses "production")
# 4. Run terraform plan -var="environment=development" (uses "development")
